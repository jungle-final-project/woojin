# Plan Reflection Check

This document checks whether the current prototype reflects `PLAN (3).md` as a team starting point. It does not grade finished feature logic.

| Final plan area | Prototype reflection | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain modules | Backend packages exist for `user`, `build`, `part`, `agent`, `rag`, `log`, `ticket`, `price`, `admin` | Reflected |
| Module ownership | Role workspace document maps each owner to folders, APIs, and first PR targets | Reflected |
| Seed ownership | Seed/mock data is split by domain seed classes instead of one shared data file | Reflected |
| 14+ user/admin screens | 17 route smoke tests cover consumer and admin implementation-start screens | Reflected |
| AI/Agent 9-step flow | Agent state timeline, RAG search, Tool invocation, fallback, and admin evidence screens exist as starting points | Reflected |
| Tool Calling policy | Tool result schema uses `PASS/WARN/FAIL`, confidence, warnings, and evidence | Reflected |
| Part/price scope | Parts, tool checks, price alerts, price snapshot collect job, and admin price job placeholders exist | Reflected |
| PC Agent/AS scope | Python CLI skeleton, log upload API, AS ticket API, admin AS detail, consent, 30-minute range, 30-day retention fields exist | Reflected |
| Infra scope | Docker Compose includes web, api, PostgreSQL pgvector, Redis, RabbitMQ, Mailpit; k6 smoke script exists | Reflected |
| MVP exclusions | README and role rules keep payment, shipping, custom remote control, exact FPS guarantee, and lowest-price guarantee out of scope | Reflected |

## Remaining Non-blockers

These are not blockers for five-person implementation start:

- OpenAPI schemas can become stricter as each owner finalizes request/response DTOs.
- Controllers still return seed-backed responses until each owner introduces service/repository logic.
- Frontend page files can be split further during feature implementation PRs.
